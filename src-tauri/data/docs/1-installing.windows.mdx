title: Install common CLI tools with Winget
platform: windows
---

Many of the commands you'll run in your shell are actually discrete programs,
and you can install more of them! There's a wide world of cool and useful
third-party command-line tools out there.

A few of the tools that are highlighted in this recipe are:

- `imagemagick` - convert and manipulate images
- `yt-dlp` - download videos (and audio) from the internet
- `gifski` - state of the art video to gif conversion

You only need to install the ones for the recipes you actually want to use. You 
often install CLI tools with a package manager. Windows 10 and 11 include one called the Windows Package Manager (`winget`).

Here's how you can install the tools we'll be using with winget.

## How to install a package with winget

Winget supports two common install command formats:

- Simple search form: `winget install <query>`
  - Lets winget search by name. May prompt you to choose a package if there are multiple matches.
- Exact ID form: `winget install -e --id <Package.Id>`
  - Uses the package identifier for an exact match. Avoids prompts and is more reliable for scripting.

In this guide we use the exact ID form. Arguments explained:

- `install`: Install a package
- `-e` / `--exact`: Require an exact match (no fuzzy search)
- `--id <Package.Id>`: Install by the package identifier from the winget repository

### ImageMagick - Image Processing

Features of ImageMagick include:
- Convert images to different formats, such as PNG, JPEG, and HEIC
- Create ICO icon files
- Convert an image with a white background to a transparent PNG
- Resize an image

<InstallBlock 
  installCommand="winget install -e --id ImageMagick.ImageMagick"
  binaryName="magick"
/>

### yt-dlp - Downloading Videos

Features of yt-dlp include:
- Download a video from popular video platforms
- Download just the audio from a video

<InstallBlock 
  installCommand="winget install -e --id yt-dlp.yt-dlp"
  binaryName="yt-dlp"
/>

### gifski - Video to GIF Conversion

<InstallBlock 
  installCommand="winget install -e --id ImageOptim.gifski"
  binaryName="gifski"
/>


## Managing Installed Packages

If you decide you no longer want a package on your system, you can uninstall it. For example, to remove ImageMagick:

```powershell
# @interactive
winget uninstall -e --id ImageMagick.ImageMagick
```

To see what you have installed with winget, run:

```powershell
# @interactive
winget list
```

## Manual Installation Check

You can also manually check if a command is installed.

In PowerShell:

```powershell
# @interactive
Get-Command magick
```

This will print the path to the command if it's installed, or nothing if it's not. Note that we used the name of the actual command you run (`magick`), which can be different from the package name in winget.
