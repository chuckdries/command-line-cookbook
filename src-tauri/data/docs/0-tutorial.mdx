title: Welcome to your command line interface

Welcome to Command Line Cookbook. I hope this resource will be helpful to you! Feel free to file an issue on GitHub if you have any trouble or ideas to improve it.

# Primer: what is a command line?

Before the mouse was invented, people used command lines to interact with their computers by entering text commands, and the computer would respond with more text.
Heck, before computers had screens, people used typewriters to communicate with their computers, and when the computer needed to show something,
it would print it out on paper. [This video by Youtube channel Usagi Electric](https://youtu.be/s0AB31qVW8U?si=8bFwCCiV1QU0LeN5&t=1342) shows this in action on the Bendix G-15,
the oldest working digital computer in North America.

Today, your OS still comes with a command line. In the age of graphical interfaces, your CLI is tucked inside an app called a "terminal emulator".
Despite its ancient roots, it's still a powerful tool for interacting with your computer.

We'll talk more about how to access your system's default terminal emulator later, but for now, CLI Cookbook comes with one built in for convenience. 
It'll open automatically when you need it, but you can also press `Show terminal` in the top right of the window. **Press that now**.

In it you should see a prompt that looks like this:

<PromptDisplay />

This is your **shell**. The shell is a program that interprets the commands you type and executes them. Your shell runs within the terminal emulator.

## How do you run a command?

Broadly, you type some text that tells your computer to do something. You can type a single word, or you can type a series of words separated by spaces. Generally,
the first word is the name of the command you want to run, and the rest are arguments that modify how the command behaves.

For example, the `echo` command prints out the text that follows it. Most code samples in Command Line Cookbook provide a "run" button for convenience,
but just this once, try clicking into the terminal panel and typing the command below by hand, then press enter.

```shell
echo "Hello world!"
```

Another common command is `ls`, which lists the files and directories in the current working directory. Try it out!

```shell
# @interactive
ls
```

This should've produced a list of files and folders such as Documents, Downloads, etc.

## What is the working directory?

The **working directory** is the directory that your shell is currently in. You can think of it as the "current location" of your shell.

Some commands care about the working directory, but others don't. It depends on what they do.

The `pwd` command prints out the current working directory. Try it out!

```shell
# @interactive
pwd
```

For most people, that should've printed your **home directory**, which is the directory where you start when you log in.
Each user account has their own home directory, and it's usually located in `/home/username` on Linux, `/Users/username` on macOS, or
`C:\Users\username` on Windows. This is where your Downloads and Documents folders live.

## Changing the working directory

The `cd` command changes the working directory. Try it out by typing `cd` followed by a space, followed by the name of one of the
folders in the output of the `ls` command you ran earlier.

```shell
# @interactive
cd Documents
```

Now, run `pwd` again to see how the working directory has changed.

```shell
# @interactive
pwd
```

## Relative vs absolute paths

In the cd command you ran above, `Documents` is a **relative path**. It's a path that refers to a location relative to the current working directory.

On the other hand, `/home/username/Documents` refers to the same location, but it is an **absolute path**. It's a path that starts from the root directory (`/` on Linux/macOS, `C:\` on Windows). Relative paths depend on context, while absolute paths always mean the same thing.

Try running the following commands

```shell
# @interactive
cd ..
```

`..` is a special relative path that means "the parent" (i.e. the folder that contains this one). You should now be back in your home directory. Confirm that with `pwd`.

```shell
# @interactive
pwd
```

That's all for now! Next, you'll want to read about how to install new command line tools.
